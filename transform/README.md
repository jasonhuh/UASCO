### How to solve

The approach for solving this problem is to implement the validation of each possible transform one by one, 
and test each of them using a simple unit test. `assert()` has been utilized as a rudimentary unittest in this program.

Using a pencil and paper to draw out a sample array, and rotating the paper was helpful when trying to figure out the
relationship between an original array and a transformed array.
